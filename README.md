# CIS130 Exam 2 – My Blog

Create a website that has 3 pages

Page 1 (index.html) – Displays entries from multiple authors. Entry may include author, date, message. Each entry should like distinct. Think of a facebook post, a twitter post or even text messages on your phone.

Page 2 (author.html) –  Click an author (besides your self) and view a profile of that author including picture and profile info

Page 3 (user.html)- Your user profile for the blog – a picture, profile info

Your site should demonstrate:

Comments including name
All pages must validate (minimum grade of C will be given if CSS or HTML pages do not validate)
Site should look professional
Use of an external stylesheet with the minimum requirements:
5 UNIQUE selectors (ie container, .className, h1, footer, #idName)
10 UNIQUE style attributes
Example of unique style attributes	
background-color:green;

Example of NOT unique: Since the attributes below are the same (background-color) this counts as only 1 unique style attribute
